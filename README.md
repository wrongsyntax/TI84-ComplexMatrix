# TI84-ComplexMatrix
A program to do RREF on a matrix with complex values, since the TI84 can't.

Using the method described in [this video.](https://youtu.be/inHqRSktULs)

## Usage

R = number of rows in the matrix.
C = number of columns in the matrix.

Then for each place in the matrix, enter the value that goes there. This can be either complex or real.

The final answer is output and stored as a list. This list can be accessed by going into the lists menu:
`[2nd][stat] â†’ RREF`
